## Question Regarding Obsidian


1. Lets say you are reading a book about `Python` and you stored the notes as chapterwise like below 

 
 * Python Intro
   * Intro
   * Git 


After a couple of months you are reading book about `javascript` and you are taking notes again 

* JavaScript 
  * Intro 

Again you have the chapter on Git on following your approach I remapped `ctrl+n` for opening the existing files . So I see there is file named **git**. Now in that case
will you create the new note under Javascript under Git and add the existing notelink or add the content under `python` and simply create the file under Javascript and link the existing file


2. After few more months you are watching the crash course on the git , in this case you will add the content to the existing notes or create the new notes . Incase
if you are adding the notes to the existing one won't it because huge junk of single file 

3.If you are taking notes on instructions would you copy paste the instructions or simply add the link to the documentation
